# Dow_Jones_Sonification
This is a program written in Processing 4 using Java that allows users to create and manipulate a musical staff, where they can drag and drop music note icons. The music note icons represent companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the vertical axis of the staff represents the time since the shares were purchased, and the horizontal axis represents the number of shares purchased. When a user drags a company onto the staff, it plays either a positive or negative music sound based on whether the company is doing well from that time point selected. The user has the ability to select how many shares purchased, because the staff can act as a mock portfolio when multiple companies are dragged onto the staff. Thus this program is both an informative and educational tool, as it encourages experimenting with different companies dates and amount of shares to intuitively learn more about companies' history in the Dow Jones. The program uses sound files and JSON data to determine the financial performance of the companies. The program also includes logic to prevent notes from overlapping on the staff. 

I created this model in the summer of 2022 as part of my internship with S&P Global.
